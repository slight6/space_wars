# Space Explorer Wiki: Genisys Torpedo System - Complete Guide

## Overview
The Genisys Torpedo System is the crown jewel of Space Explorer, allowing players to create entire solar systems through supercompressed particle torpedoes. Each torpedo contains the raw materials and quantum algorithms needed to forge worlds, moons, and celestial phenomena from the void of space.

## How It Works

### The Formation Process
When a Genisys Torpedo is launched, it enters a **Formation Phase** lasting 2-7 hours. During this time, the torpedo's supercompressed particles undergo quantum crystallization, gradually eliminating possibilities until a final planetary outcome emerges.

### Randomization Mechanics
The system uses **Progressive Elimination** - starting with hundreds of possibilities across multiple categories, options are randomly eliminated over time until only one remains in each category. This creates truly unique worlds that couldn't be manually designed.
