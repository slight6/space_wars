- **Resources**: All periodic table elements available
- **Role**: Planetary development and colonization

### 2. MOON SPECIALIZATIONS
- **Edison**: Research and industry hub (474,605 population)
- **McCormick**: Agricultural production center (474,605 population)  
- **Hoover**: Mining and resource extraction (474,600 population)
- **Historical Isolation**: 1000-year separation period, now connected via Nexus

### 3. NEXUS STATION GAMEPLAY ROLE
- **Current**: Testing ground for all game features
- **Population**: 125,000
- **Future**: Limited operations once live testing moves elsewhere
- **Services**: Full shipyard, marketplace, research facilities
- **Purpose**: Training and development hub for new players

### 4. SATELLITE FUNCTIONS
- **Archimedes**: Research platform with advanced laboratories
- **Hermes**: Communications hub for system-wide networking
- **Aegis**: Defense platform (peaceful zone, neighbor assistance focused)

### 5. GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE
- **The State**: Shadow government with limited visibility
- **12 Specialists**: Mission/quest providers working for The State
- **Authority**: Absolute but operates through specialist intermediaries

### 6. SYSTEM PURPOSE & PROGRESSION
- **Training Focus**: Players learn from moon specialists
- **Skill Development**: Each moon teaches different specializations
- **Exploration Preparation**: Building toward colonization missions
- **Economic Development**: Transparent credit flow system

### 7. RESOURCE ECONOMICS
- **Periodic Shipments**: From distant testing ground
- **Contents**: Goods, services, colonists
- **Financial Transparency**: All credit flows visible to players
- **Investment Areas**: Infrastructure, research, resource gathering

### 8. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
- **War of 3088**: Cataclysmic explosion scattered fleets
- **Arrival**: Unknown number of ships reached Keldar
- **Reconstruction**: 2062 years of rebuilding civilization
- **Governmental Rift (4150)**: Led to 1000-year moon separation
- **Technological Boom**: Post-Nexus reunification

### 9. POPULATION DISTRIBUTION
- **Moon Balance**: Nearly equal populations across Edison, McCormick, Hoover
- **Nexus Crew**: Small specialized station population
- **Keldar Focus**: Large population working on planetary habitability

### 10. RESOURCE AVAILABILITY
- **Complete Periodic Table**: All elements 1-118 available in system
- **Abundance Tiers**: Common to exotic material classifications
- **Specialization**: Each location has resource focus areas

## REPUTATION SYSTEM DETAILS
- **In-depth tracking**: Complex reputation calculations
- **Crime mechanics**: High reputation blocks minor crimes
- **Negative progression**: Players can turn to criminal activities
- **Faction control**: Underground/black market operations
- **Redemption paths**: Easier recovery from moderate negative reputation
- **Special crimes**: High-reputation players have access to unique criminal opportunities

---

## MARKETPLACE DYNAMICS  
- **Crown Jewel Status**: Market is the "setting for gemstones" (if Genisys is crown jewel)
- **Variable Systems**: Hundreds of aspects affecting market conditions
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Completely random but player-event influenced
- **Event Responses**: Markets shift based on player actions
- **Manipulation Potential**: Small-scale market influence possible

## FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AREAS

### Travel Mechanics
- **Status**: To be discussed at length
- **Scope**: System-wide and eventually inter-system
- **Scale**: Potential for 1,000+ sector distances
- **Timeline**: Real-time travel mechanics (possibly years for distant locations)

### Database Migration
- **Current**: JSON data files for initial development
- **Future**: PostgreSQL migration planned for live testing
- **Benefit**: Easier data migration, code preservation

### Colonist Introduction
- **Timing**: After core mechanics testing
- **Method**: Additional form of player introduction
- **Purpose**: Population growth and system expansion

### Template System
- **Purpose**: Keldar system as template for future areas
- **Scale**: Potentially 1,000+ sectors for exploration
- **Discovery**: New areas for long-term gameplay
