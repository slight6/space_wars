## TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE RECOMMENDATIONS

### Data Flow Priority
1. **JSON Data Files** → **Game Logic** → **UI Display**
2. **Player Actions** → **Data Updates** → **System Responses**
3. **External Events** → **Market Changes** → **Player Notifications**

### Development Approach
- **Data-First Development**: Complete data structures before UI
- **Modular Implementation**: Each system as independent module
- **Template-Based Expansion**: Keldar as template for future systems
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Basic functionality first, complexity later

### Migration Strategy
- **JSON Structure**: Design for easy PostgreSQL migration
- **Code Separation**: Data access layer separate from game logic
- **Version Control**: Track data schema changes carefully
- **Testing Framework**: Validate data integrity throughout development

This analysis provides the framework for prioritizing development while ensuring all user requirements are addressed systematically.
